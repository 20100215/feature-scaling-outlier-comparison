# feature-scaling-outlier-comparison
 Comparing the impacts of the distribution of data with outliers using different scaling techniques

 Notebooks are taken from the example discussion sites in scikit-learn. 
 
 Further comments and illustrations will be added to further discuss the mathematical aspects and performance impacts on the techniques and on other datasets.

- plot_all_scaling.ipynb -> Provides comparison of different scaling techniques applied.
- plot_scaling_importance.ipynb -> Provides comparison of results in ML model performance with and without scaling applied.
